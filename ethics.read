Ethics laid down to make you stronger: Narrate this to yourself, or the others with whom you have interactions. This will only make you stronger and not weaker. Keeping a clear communication and having a clear profile and attitude is detrimental to your success and to everything in your life. 

1. I don't work on the past, never ever and I work on the present to make a better future. If you believe that I work on the past and live in the past then you should ask. Seeing and assuming anything is free but it doesn't mean that it should be true. Therefore ask the person directly and when you ask the person directly then have the trust in the same. 
2. I have a lot to say about myself and to listen about them, so I don't speak about others. I don't spread negativity, criticism and any other such words. You should not entertain people, who spread negativity, criticism or anything without even knowing you. The reason being that they have lost their mental attitude that they are spilling words about a person, whom they have never met, never talked to and anything. So it means you talk about a communication that never happened and you talk about a person that you don't even know, then it means that you are talking about something, which dont even exist and these are signs of mental sickness. So if you trust then it is your fault and not the other person, who is spreading so before you blame the person, who is spreading, make an attempt to check the same. Ask them to confront the person, who is speaking and other approaches.
3. I speak true words so that I can put my focus and attention to the work that really matters. A manipulator or attention seeker will speak false and his or her words will modulate every time and the best part they ask you to go silent and ask you not to speak about this to anyone, so in true words, you will spend your mind and thinking about those more and it will destroy your mental peace. This speaking truth gives me sanity as then people know where they stand and how they matter. Actually this will induce a kind of irrational behavior and attitude, which is baseless.
4. I evaluate people by talking and not by anything else as when you talk to someone, you get to know them better than just by watching. I stay away from those people, who become your friend without even knowing you, talking to you and then become also your enemy. You should be way about such people as if they can do to others they can do the same to you. Basically they are making each other enemies, whereas you have a gift that if you want to talk to someone and if approached then you can say, sorry i am not interested and at the same time, you can say that i am interested. If the person has self respect, will understand this for the first time and if not then you cant put self respect in someone. In my image, those people who listen to others and close the connections are the dumbest people in this world as they prove that they have only one ear, so whatever you feed it will go into the brain. They don't have a filtering mechanism. 
5. Never listen to a person, who is talking excessively about others as it shows that he or she has nothing to talk about him or her and that is why they are invested in others. If you hear anything, and you have the ability to ask the person, always make an attempt to ask. You never know whether you are listening to the correct person or not. Putting others down will not raise me, or will bring me to glory that is why I invest my efforts in myself. I never work on imagination, I work on what is in front. You can have as many imaginations as you want, you can have as many guesses you want but there is no meaning in believing in them. I never approach anyones any person behind their back, and I strongly believe in this as this destroys an image that you are not a stable minded and there is more truth to it. Everyone has a different personality and if you approach and say and you might hear different and when you reciprocate you will not hear the same, leading to misunderstanding. 
6. If someone is saying bad things to me about others and the other person is important to me. I will say let me confront this to the other person because losing a person based on someone else's thinking is showing that i don't have a thinking of my own. Who knows that the person is speaking just because of jealousy or something else and whether it is right or not. I believe that once it is destroyed, reconciliation of the same is not as strong as it can be the first time. So believe in your acts when you do something. Never trust a person who establishes correlations and unnecessary thinking, as it is not about the psychology it is about that they can turn into any imaginary aspects and the outcomes are humiliating. 
7. If you are happy then you don't look into others. You only look into others when you are not happy. I don't make decisions on or for someone's happiness as that is taking someone's birth right to decide for himself or herself. Never trust a friend, employer who is giving more importance to the employee family than the employee itself. Why I say this is that the employee is the first line of the contact, so building his or her happiness will automatically build everything. You don't have to go out of the way to do anything else.  A friend who is more invested in an employee's family than the friend itself is the one, who is seeking the space in the family so that he or she can jump or break them according to their needs.  Therefore, the employer should give first importance to the employee as that builds confidence in the employee and gives a strength that i am getting the respect i deserve and my employer thinks about me. If you are more interested in my family members rather than building the relationship the employee at first, go and hire them first. 
8. I don't find people in other people as no two people can be the same. Those who waste their time doing this regret that they have destroyed everything by doing this.If someone has broken the relation with me based on someone else's words then I never search for them and neither do I think about them, as to me those people are the ones that are paying for what they have sown. This is a big point as who told you to believe, don't you have a mouth to ask?. and now since you have done, so i can't do anything about that. Why do I have to waste time thinking what is the reason?, this is not an ancient crisis. There are many people out there. 
9. I don’t interact with those people who are using their powers and energies in the wrong direction. Putting your energy in the wrong direction by listening to the wrong people is already a sign that they can put me on a wrong track and when you are on a wrong track, you don't show results instead you disturb other people, induce negativity and back talking and other in their lives and make a negative culture.So if someone says to me that we can talk about the other concerned person, i say that if you have the liberty to say in front of that person, what you are saying then it means you are saying truth else you are speaking false and i am not interested in taking part in such activities. 
10. I don’t waste time monitoring people as that will not give me anything. Neither do I look or search for any specific people as I have to do what others are doing. This is simply a waste of time that most people do as they lack the ability to talk to someone. When you don’t talk anyone can say anything, but when you talk among your people and everything then the outsiders know that we can’t spread assumptions or negativity as they will talk among themselves and the truth comes out. 

I will continue to update this more… as I have several of them written and I appreciate your words here so that I can broaden my view and make my surroundings stronger. Thank you.
