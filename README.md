#### This page is used for quick look when I am coding and I forgot some inbuilt function or class reference. It doesnt provide any code itself. I believe that no book or code courses teaches you how to write code for specific applications, specific projects and analysis. They simply teaches you how to declare variables, write functions. These are only links that I am programming currently and need it as a reference.

> If you program and write code most of the day then to increase your vision and transparency and also to give your eyes a little bit rest, you  can find some themes here: [vscode_themes](https://vscodethemes.com/). 

> Best online conversion that you can use for any format. I use this only all the time mainly. [cloudconvert](https://cloudconvert.com/) and in case you are writing still C++ then the reference link for the C++  [cppreference](https://en.cppreference.com/w/)

###### Rules for better code strategies 
:thumbsup:  Keep a day off from the code and make it more attendable. Going through all the code, bug fixes and everything. \
:thumbsup:  Dont go for all the programming languages, select which are necessary and develop them. \
:thumbsup:  Clean the code and also forked repositories once a week, in which you are not programming or coding at all.\
:thumbsup:  There is no limit in customization and everything but i believe that this will do all work so i am not a big fan of daily customization terminals or themes.
